1. Not sure, to be honest. I joined in after this lesson.


2. Taking a guess here:
  Start — Initial state when a process is first started.
  Ready — Process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
  Running — After the OS scheduler assigns a process to a processor, the processor excutes its instructions.
  Waiting — Process is in waiting state if it needs to wait for a resource or user input.
  Terminated/Exit — Process finishes its execution, or is terminated by the OS.
